description: 'This resource contains lecture discourse which describes how an outer
  measure such as nu is a rather crude object since, even

  if the Ai are disjoint, there is generally strict inequality, how unreasonable it
  is to expect equality in it, and for disjoint

  unions, for a function defined on all subsets of X and why should we restrict

  attention to smaller collections of subsets and supporting definitions, theorems,
  prpopositions and proofs.'
