description: This resource contains 6 problems (1-5 and 11) from the course notes
  and hints to solve them. The problems are on local compactness of a metric space,
  proof for general case by induction over n, sigma-algebras are closed under countable
  intersections, in a locally compact metric space compact subsets are measurable
  for any Borel measure.
