Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1 hour / session

Prerequisite
------------

Fourier Analysis - Theory and Applications ([18.103](/courses/18-103-fourier-analysis-fall-2013))

Text
----

Rudin, W. _Real and Complex Analysis._ 3rd ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, 1987. ISBN: 0070542341.

Description
-----------

The course materials were presented according to the following breakdown of lectures:

*   Five lectures on measure and integration - Leading to Riesz representation theorem
*   Seven lectures on distributions and Fourier transform - Including Schwart space, Sobolev spaces and Sobolev embedding
*   Seven lectures on differential operators with constant coefficients, fundamental solutions and hypoellipticity
*   Four lectures on operators, trace class, Hilbert-Schmid

Projects
--------

To pass the course each student was required to carry out one of the projects which were described in the second week of classes. The following projects were suggested to the students:

1.  Radon-Nikodym theorem
2.  Kuiper's theorem: The group of unitary operators on a (separable infinite dimensional) Hilbert space is contractible
3.  Seeley's extension theorem
4.  Gibb's phenomenon
5.  Surjectivity of any non-trivial constant coefficient differential operator, _P_: _S'_ (Rn) → _S'_ (Rn)
6.  Every elliptic differential operator with constant coefficients is surjective as a map on _C_∞(_U_), for any open set _U_ ⊂ Rn
7.  Lidskii's theorem on trace class operators on _L_2(Rn)

Grading
-------

The final grade was based on the homework and the project. There were no tests or examinations.
